release: "4.3"
version: [1]
scope: ucs_4.3-0-errata4.3-1
src: dpkg
fix: 1.18.25
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Parse start-stop-daemon usernames and groupnames starting with digits in -u
   and -c correctly.
 * Always use the binary version for the .buildinfo filename in
   dpkg-genbuildinfo.
 * Fix integer overflow in deb(5) format version parser.
 * Fix directory traversal with dpkg-deb --raw-extract, by guaranteeing that
   the DEBIAN pathname does not exist.
 * Do not try to recompute hashes for the .dsc file when signing binary-only
   builds in dpkg-buildpackage.
 * Architecture support: Add support for riscv64 CPU.
 * Perl modules: Do not normalize args past a passthrough stop word in
   Dpkg::Getopt. Some commands pass some arguments through to another command,
   and those must not be normalized as that might break their invocation.
 * Documentation: - Update buildinfo information in dpkg-buildpackage man page
   to match the current implementation. - Use correct name for archname
   validator value in dpkg(1) man page. - Update git URLs for move away from
   alioth.debian.org.
 * Packaging: Add versioned Build-Depends on tar, due to the --clamp-mtime
   option being used in Dpkg::Source::Archive which is used by dpkg-source,
   used by the test suite.
 * Updated programs and man pages translations
