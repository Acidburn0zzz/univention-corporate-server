desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Backport for working around an issue in APR's trunc API. This is a
   prerequisite for the SHA1/shattered fixes.
 * Backport to prevent the possibility of rep-sharing between a directory rep
   and a file/prop rep.
 * Backport to reject commits which would introduce hash collisions with
   existing data, thus addressing the SHA1/shattered issue.
