 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Continue samba-tool dbcheck --fix even if a modification failed.
 * Changing the primary group of a user triggered an inconsistency in
   the DN SID component of the member attribute. In special situations
   samba-tool dbcheck was unable to fix this automatically.
